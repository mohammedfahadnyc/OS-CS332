 Task 3, part 2: Write a program where a child is created to execute a command
     that shows all files (including hid- den files) in a directory with
     information such as permissions, owner, size, and when last modified.
     Use execvp(...). For the command to list directory contents with various
     options, refer the handout on Unix file system sent to you in the first class.
     Announce the successful forking of child process by displaying its PID.
